This project was to solve a real business problem, and have a go at learning go. 

There were some things I took for granted- the pkg/sftp package is not a sftp server. it is a SFTP protocol handler, not a full blown sftp server. (i was expecting the package to have the ability to restrict connected users to certain dir )


this is a ftp proxy to solve a problem where a netsuite script cannot handle a file larger than 100mb
